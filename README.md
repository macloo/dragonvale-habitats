# Dragonvale Habitat Planner

[Dragonvale](http://www.backflipstudios.com/games/dragonvale/) is a mobile game by Backflip Studios. This app attempts to solve a problem encountered by high-level players who have hundreds of dragons and dozens of habitats and want to maximize the “earnings” their dragons produce.

By choosing a habitat here, you can then try out different combinations of dragons to discover how to get the most out of each habitat.

This app is not associated in any way with Backflip.

## Notes

* In this habitat
* With these dragons
* At these levels
* How long until max coins are reached? (in hours)

1. Choose habitat
2. Number of dragons is given
3. Eligible dragons are loaded
4. Pick a dragon and its level
5. When all dragons selected, get total time until full (or — total per hour?)

## Progress to date

* Table created for all habitats that earn 1 million coins or more.
* Habitat table is sortable on all columns.
